Starting to do my own setup now

---
## Includes sane configurations for the following:

1. Neovim
2. Zsh (Oh-my-ZSH)
3. Yabai
4. SKHD
6. Stow
7. iTerm2
8. Karabiner-elements
9. Kitty (recommended over iTerm2)
10. LF File Manager
11. Zed
12. Tmux
13. CoPilot

Want to run this to get nvim helpers into python and node:
pip install pynvim
npm i -g neovim
